# Bus Simulation
* By Lucas Ferreira.
* This is an implementation of a bus system where events are generated in sequence. It utilizes Python's own 'random' library to simulate an exponentially distributed arrival of new passengers.
## Run the program
* Install Python 3.8.
* To run the simulation, run the function bus_sim().
* Parameters are configured for case suggested in the assignment description.
## Output
* The arrival of departure of each bus at each bus stop is printed to the console.
* A .csv file containing snapshots of postions of every bus and queue sizes thorughout the simulation is generated.
